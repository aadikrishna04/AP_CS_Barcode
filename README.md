# ApCSbarcode
A program made to validate 12 digit barcodes based on checksum.

I found a paper on the CHS floor which had a Java problem on it. It looked interesting and so I tried to solve it. I succeeded. And then I succeeded a second time using another method because I was extremely bored. One method is very dumb in my mind, and the other one is slightly less dumb but took longer to code.
